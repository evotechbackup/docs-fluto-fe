It provides users with a Dashboard for a real-time overview of inventory status, a Store section to manage storage locations, and features like Delivery Notes to track shipments. With structured categories such as Equipment, Vehicles, Consumables, and Materials, users can effectively organize and monitor their stock. The module also includes Inventory Adjustment tools to ensure accurate stock levels and rectify discrepancies. This integrated approach minimizes errors, enhances operational control, and supports seamless inventory management across business functions.\nIt is linked with Procurement module (where inventory is added on Purchase received) and linked to Project module where Project manager assigns products to the project or job site\nThe Inventory Module in QuantumFlow is a powerful, real-time inventory management system built to help businesses of all sizes maintain optimal stock levels, improve supply chain visibility, reduce carrying costs, and prevent stockouts or overstocking. Whether managing a single warehouse or multiple job sites across geographies, this module offers a centralized platform to track, control, and optimize inventory movements with precision and efficiency.\nIn today's dynamic business landscape, inventory is more than just stock—it's capital. Mismanaged inventory can lead to delayed projects, dissatisfied customers, increased holding costs, and revenue loss. The Inventory Module addresses these risks by offering robust tools for stock monitoring, valuation, demand forecasting, and intelligent replenishment strategies—ensuring your inventory works for your business, not against it.",

          "1.What is Maintenance Management?\n \tIt is the process of planning, scheduling, and tracking maintenance activities for vehicles, equipment, or assets to ensure smooth operations and minimize downtime.\n2. What types of maintenance are supported?\n \tThe system supports preventive maintenance, corrective maintenance, scheduled inspections, and emergency repairs.\n3. What is a Service Entry?\n \tA Service Entry records the details of a maintenance service performed on a vehicle or equipment, including tasks, labor, parts used, and costs.\n4. What is a Work Order?\n \tA Work Order is a formal request to perform maintenance. It contains details like vehicle/equipment info, service priority, assigned employees, schedule, and issues to be resolved.\n5. How do I create a Work Order?\n \tGo to Maintenance → Work Order → New Work Order, fill in details like vehicle info, odometer reading, issue dates, assigned employees, and identified issues, then save.\n6. What's the difference between Service Entry and Work Order?\n\tWork Order → Created before maintenance, describing what needs to be done.\n\tService Entry → Created after maintenance, recording what was actually done.\n7. What is a Service Task?\n \tA Service Task defines a specific maintenance activity (e.g., oil change, brake inspection). It helps standardize recurring maintenance actions.\n8. Can I create custom Service Tasks?\n \tYes. Go to Maintenance → Service Tasks → Add Service Task, fill in task name, description, category, system, assembly, and repair codes, then save.\n9. How do I create a new Part to the system?\n \tGo to Inventory → Parts → Create New Part, upload an image, enter Part Name, SKU, description, unit of measure, and minimum required quantity if needed, then save.\n10. What is SKU?\n \tSKU (Stock Keeping Unit) is a unique identifier for each part in the inventory for easier tracking.\n11. Can I track low stock alerts for parts?\n \t Yes. When you enable Minimum Required Quantity (MRQ) for a part, the system can notify you when stock falls below the threshold.\n12. How do I schedule preventive maintenance?\n \tWhen creating a Work Order, set Scheduled Start Date and Scheduled Completion Date. The system can send reminders for upcoming maintenance.\n13. Can I track overdue maintenance?\n \tYes. The dashboard highlights overdue inspections and pending service tasks.",
